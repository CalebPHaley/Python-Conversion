# Java to Python Conversion
Previous Project Examples:

This project contains a Java Authentication system which I converted into Python to achieve the same functionality as it did before alterations.  This is an older school project which gave users the option to sign into different systems depending on their login information. There are two main logins, one for the zookeepers and one for the veterinarian.  This utilizes an MD5 hash for enconding which was a bit different in Python than Java.  Java makes it easier to implement the MD5 than Python, but it is still achievable in either language.

Both programs use the same text files and output in the same way. You can test the original Java program to get a baseline and cross-reference the Python program for operability.
