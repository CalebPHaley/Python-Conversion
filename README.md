# Java to Python Conversion
Previous Project Examples
The Milestone 2 folder contains the program for the Milestone 2 project and part 1 of the final project. There are two folders within this directory; one has the old Java program, and one has the converted Python program. The actual submission can be found in the NewCode folder. This code functions very similarly to the Java project. The main difference is the MD5 hash function is quite a bit different in Python; and has a generally easier method than the standard way in Java. I added a few improvements to this project; including better login functionality, MD5 password checking, and improved read speeds.
